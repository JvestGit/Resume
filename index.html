        <hr />
        <p>
          I am still early into my professional career but I feel rather
          fortunate to be in the position that I am in. Even though I am young,
          I have had amazing mentors, phenomenal teachers, and have developed a
          lot of soft skills that can help me in the professional enviornment. I
          am still developing my techincal skills, but I have been programming
          websites and small games as a hobby for a few years now. I have used
          Python, Java, HTML/CSS, and C# to program everything from daily task
          reminders to full fledge games.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I sill do not have any professional experience in programming or
          software development, I have plent of amateur experience as well as a
          drive to learn and do the best work that I possibly could. I am
          passionate about computer programming and view it as more than a
          possible career. This is not just a career or hobby for me, this is
          something that I love to do and want to do for the rest of my life. I
          want to create solutions to problems and make an information system
          the most effient it can be. I have a love and passion for software
          developement and am ready to jump in do what I want to do.

          I have been making small game projects for a few years now. They are
